  <h2>Progress Report 2022-09-05</h2>

  <em>By Ryan J. Price @ 2022-09-05 01:45:00 -0500 CDT; reading time 3m</em>
  <hr/>

  <p>Wooooo boy howdy, what a STRETCH it&rsquo;s been. Lots of things in life &amp; work have
come up and kept me away from working on OSC, but I wanted to throw out
something quick to let folks know that neither I nor the project are dead.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><a href="https://github.com/opensourcecorp/rhad"><code>rhad</code></a> has been under a lot of
recent work. Some months ago, the concept of a <code>Rhadfile</code> was introduced to
the codebase, which is a config-file format for <code>rhad</code> executions. The first
pass at this was targeting an INI format, for its simplicity &amp; readability. As
it turns out, parsing an INI file is&hellip; interesting, to say the least. So,
<code>Rhadfiles</code> are now <a href="https://toml.io">TOML</a>-formatted. TOML is a nice
middle-ground format of being readable, writable, and parseable. Right now,
<code>Rhadfiles</code> only support providing a version number for your code tree
modules, but more options will spring up as they become apparent.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also <a href="https://github.com/opensourcecorp/rhad/pkgs/container/rhad/tree/main/scripts/run-rhad-lint.sh">a helper
script</a>
that runs the GitHub Super-Linter, and <code>rhad</code> following, as well as a <code>make add-local-symlinks</code> target to symlink the script onto (what I hope is) your
<code>$PATH</code>. Try it out and let me know if you run into any notable bugs.</p>
<p><code>rhad</code> is now version <code>v0.3.0</code>, and the <a href="https://github.com/opensourcecorp/rhad/pkgs/container/rhad">container image on
GHCR</a> reflects
this in its <code>:latest</code> tag (I&rsquo;ll get around to getting version-tagged builds
done in GHA at some point).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>While working on <code>rhad</code>, I started to think that abstracting out some of the
reusable Go functionality might be beneficial in the long run &ndash; so now we
have <a href="https://github.com/opensourcecorp/go-common"><code>a repo to house that</code></a>
(currently it&rsquo;s just logging functionality). This kind of felt like premature
optimization, since nothing else except <code>ghostwriter</code> is using this shareable
functionality, but it ended up teaching me an awful lot about how to work with
dependency packages in Go that <em>you</em> control &ndash; like being able to override
exported fields in child packages to disable log output for tests, set custom
log prefixes without boilerplate, etc. Seeing it all come together was a cool
feeling.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>And now for the parts that I haven&rsquo;t touched in long enough that I forget most
of the finer details:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>The <a href="https://github.com/opensourcecorp/osc-infra/tree/feature/bootstrapper-add-aws"><code>osc-infra</code>
bootstrapper</a>
is almost ready to support AWS! we&rsquo;re using Terraform Provisioners like
sinners. It&rsquo;s neat. Also, as mentioned in the last post <code>osc-infra</code> is now
under tagged releases, and the most recent version is now v0.2.0.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The <code>local-vm</code> bootstrapper has been refactored to not build separate images
for ever ysingle subsystem, and just run provision calls at runtime. This
makes the OSC cluster <em><strong>way faster</strong></em> to bootstrap, saves on disk space since
there&rsquo;s no persistent storage of other images, etc. This also came along with
a number of other cleanup changes while I was crawling around in the codebase,
e.g. the <code>imgbuilder</code> subsystem is now named <code>baseimg</code>.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Previously, when setting up a <code>redis</code> service on <code>datastore</code>, I must have
stumbled onto a docs page that told readers that the ideal way to install
<code>redis</code> was to compile it from source, and <em><strong>not</strong></em> use something like an APT
repo. I&rsquo;m not sure what I found, or if something changed, but <code>redis</code> is now
installed via an APT repo, and it works fine <code>:shrug:</code></p>
</li>
<li>
<p><code>configmgmt</code> had a Salt block that added a swapfile to cluster nodes, and that
block was commented out. I don&rsquo;t recall <em><strong>why</strong></em> it was commented out, but
now it&rsquo;s not, and is working as expected. All nodes now have a swapfile
(insert Oprah &ldquo;you get a car&rdquo; meme here).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Like I said above, this isn&rsquo;t a massive update, nor is it super clean, but
posting all this to say that I&rsquo;ve not disappeared, nor stopped working on OSC.
Life, uh, finds a way (to get in the way).</p>
