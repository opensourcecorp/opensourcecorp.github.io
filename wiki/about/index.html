  <h2>About OSC</h2>
  <hr>
<p>Originally named &ldquo;Project Optimus&rdquo; and started in March 2021 by <a href="https://github.com/ryapric">Ryan
Price</a>, OpenSourceCorp (OSC) was first intended as a
dumping ground for <a href="https://github.com/ryapric?tab=repositories">all of Ryan&rsquo;s own disparate, growing code
repos</a>. As he started to add new
codebases, he thought it might be more valuable to readers to try organizing the
content into something more cohesive. After a lot of spooling on how that might
look &amp; act, OSC was publicly announced in July 2021.</p>
<p>You can read about the motivations for OSC on <a href="/">the homepage</a>.</p>

<p><em><strong>Ryan J. Price</strong></em></p>
<p><em><strong>President, CEO, everything else for now</strong></em></p>
<p>Ryan is the founder of OpenSourceCorp. He has been working in tech since ~2010
when he was hacking on the point-of-sale systems in the restaurants he worked
in. A self-proclaimed &ldquo;GNU/Linux neckbeard&rdquo;, he has been involved in
contributing to open-source work since 2017, having first given back to the OSS
community via the <a href="https://github.com/ryapric/loggit">loggit package for R</a>.
Passionate about educating others and helping them to realize their knowledge
potential, he started OSC to give back something more broadly meaningful (if not
infinitely more complex) to the community that has supported him all these
years.</p>
