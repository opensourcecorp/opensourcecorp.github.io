[OpenSourceCorp's home repo](https://github.com/opensourcecorp/opensourcecorp)
has [a new architecture
diagram](https://github.com/opensourcecorp/opensourcecorp/blob/main/docs/architecture.md)
up! This diagram provides a high-level layout of the architecural flows for the
current & future core OpenSourceCorp platforms. It's pretty rough at the time of
this posting, but I'm not exactly a designer :)

If you peruse the [various repos](https://github.com/opensourcecorp) across OSC,
you'll notice that most are still empty placeholders, not-yet-functional, or
still need some serious work -- but many have continued to receive updates to
their codebases (still just me over here!). As we continue to reach towards
realizing our vision, the above diagram is what will help inform our
architectural decisions, code design, workflows, framework behavior, and more.
It will continue to receive updates and tweaks as we get more clarity on
implementation realities, make tool selections, etc.

So stay tuned for more! Lots of great stuff coming soon.
