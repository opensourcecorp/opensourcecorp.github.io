      <h2>OpenSourceCorp - The Free and Open-Source Enterprise</h2>
      <hr>
<p>Here at OpenSourceCorp, we strive to provide an opinionated perspective on how
software systems work &ldquo;in real life&rdquo;. We don&rsquo;t have some grand monetization
vision for ourselves, nor do we propose anything particularly novel in <em>what</em> we
do. What we do is collaborate to write application code that runs on
infrastructure deployed via CI/CD pipelines, secured via applicable industry
best-practices, and supported by comprehensive documentation.</p>
<p>The novel component that we provide is that we do all of this work <em><strong>100% in
the open</strong></em>.</p>
<p>We do this because we have developed a general frustration with <em><strong>how</strong></em> modern
teams are expected to learn different things &ndash; especially how so many tools,
technologies, and processes are used in concert with each other in a broader
enterprise ecosystem. There are plenty of tutorials and &ldquo;getting started&rdquo; guides
for any number of tools or topics, but while several of these have supplements
for their use in a larger ecosystem, they&rsquo;ve never feel like quite enough to
document the holistic lifecycle of a use case. The most valuable learning
material for <em>real</em> use cases happens within company walls with propietary
software &ndash; where if you&rsquo;re not an employee, you don&rsquo;t get to learn.</p>
<p>Take any given, relatively-complex software, like <a href="https://kafka.apache.org/">Apache
Kafka</a> or <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs">HashiCorp
Vault</a>. Their respective documentation portals
are very comprehensive, and provide a wealth of use cases, simple &amp; complex
configurations, and more.</p>
<p>But what if you&rsquo;re self-hosting a production-quality cluster at your company?
How do you <em>actually</em> deploy that cluster, and not rely on manually launching it
via the (usually very good) installation instructions? Do you bootstrap some EC2
machines in a CloudFormation template for an AWS deployment? Do you do that
bootstrapping with raw shell code, <a href="https://docs.ansible.com/">Ansible</a>, or
something else?</p>
<p>Or maybe you stuff containers into <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/">Kubernetes</a>?
The docs for Vault, for example, provide a <a href="https://www.vaultproject.io/docs/platform/k8s/helm">Helm
chart</a>, sure &ndash; but what if
your team/company doesn&rsquo;t use Helm?</p>
<p>Or, isn&rsquo;t <em><strong>allowed</strong></em> to use Helm? We haven&rsquo;t even touched on the security
considerations that your company might take against any tools, and those
considerations vary wildly for the <em>same</em> tool across orgs. A version bump for a
Java library might be a few hours of testing &amp; validation in some orgs, but
(literally) <em>years</em> of security review in others, <em>before</em> you&rsquo;re even allowed
to start doing those same upgrade validations.</p>
<p>All of this begs the same question again &ndash; <em><strong>how do you actually work with
this stuff in real life?</strong></em></p>
<p>These, and ever more questions, are what OpenSourceCorp aims to provide answers
&amp; perspective for. Real code, real solutions, for real enterprise challenges.</p>
